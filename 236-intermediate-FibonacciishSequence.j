NB. A monad which generates fibonacci numbers until greater than or equal to y:

    fibUpTo =. monad : 0
((,[:+/_2&{.)^:(x >: {:)^:_) (0 1)
)

NB. A dyad which takes a list y and finds members which are factors of x:

  findFactors =: ]#~0=|~

NB. With that, we can find the solution:

   x:@(] % {:@(findFactors fibUpTo)) 123456789
41152263
